# The "Just Do Whatever" License

Copyright (c) 2025 Eurovision Tier List Makers

## Legal Jargon That Nobody Actually Reads

Hereby, I, the creators of this magnificent Eurovision Tier List software, grant you—yes, YOU—an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, zero-cost license to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, sell, dance around with, sing about, or do absolutely whatever you want with this software.

## In Plain English (Because Let's Be Honest, That's What You're Reading)

* Want to use this code? Go ahead!
* Want to modify it? Be my guest!
* Want to sell it? Douze points to your entrepreneurial spirit!
* Want to take credit for writing it? Well, that's a bit rude, but legally and technically permissible!

## The Small Print (Barely Legal, Like Some Eurovision Performances)

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

## In Even Plainer English

If this software accidentally deletes your hard drive or causes an international incident because you used it to rank Sweden above Finland (2023 (how dare you)), that's on you. I AM NOT responsible. :3

## Final Note

While I find legal licenses about as necessary as a swimsuit in Antarctica, my lawyers (who definitely exist and aren't just figments of my imagination) insisted I include this. Enjoy the software, and may our Eurovision experience be forever controversial!

*P.S. If you're reading this far, you deserve a cookie. Go get one. I'll wait.*
